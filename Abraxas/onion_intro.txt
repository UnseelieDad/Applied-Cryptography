You will definitely need your complete programs for the Caesar and key
ciphers.  You will also need your problem solving skills.

Also, the following alphabet may come in handy:

7JZv. 964jMLh)5QtAS2PXWaFU8,/cpkY'O(Tqr?dsEmbRwINVKBez1=3+H0GyfxCiD"lg:!uo

By the way, it may help to know that, if a key was used to encrypt plaintext,
it begins with the 41st letter of the alphabet.

Good luck!
